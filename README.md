# Heron-s_Formula_Calculator
In geometry, Heron's formula (sometimes called Hero's formula), named after Hero of Alexandria, gives the area of a triangle when the length of all three sides are known. Unlike other triangle area formulae, there is no need to calculate angles or other distances in the triangle first.
In special cases where only the sides of a quadrilateral is given, you can use this code to calculate thearea of the quadrilateral after dividing the quadrilateral into two triangles.
This code is written in Python 3.9.1
